= Building a Branded Desktop Sync Client

== Introduction

To build a branded Desktop sync client, you need to supply your own artwork and use the ownBrander wizard in your account on https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud[customer.owncloud.com]. The ownBrander wizard details the required image specifications.

== Build Process

In the ownBrander wizard at your account, start with the Common section at the top, and enter information common to all clients that you can build with ownBrander. You may override any settings inside the _Common_ section of the _Client_ sections.

Then go to the _Desktop client section_ of ownBrander, which has two sections, _Required_ and _Optional_.

Work your way through the wizard, enter required elements and any optional elements you wish. When you have completed the wizard, press the btn:[Generate Desktop Client] button. You will either get messages warning of any items that need to be corrected, or a success message.

It takes 24-48 hours to build your client. When finalized you will see it in your account on https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud[customer.owncloud.com].
