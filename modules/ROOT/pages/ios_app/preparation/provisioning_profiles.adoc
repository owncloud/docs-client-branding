= Create Provisioning Profiles
:toc: right
:description: A provisioning profile is a collection of information that links an App ID with signing certificates and authorized devices.

== Introduction

{description} It is used to control and authorize the devices on which the app can run and the Apple services it can access.

== Overview

Eight provisioning profiles need to be created:

* 4 ad hoc and
* 4 app store.

You will email the four ad hoc profiles and your P12 certificate (which you will create after your provisioning profiles), to support@owncloud.com after building your branded app with the ownBrander app on {customer-owncloud-url}[customer.owncloud.com]. *Do not send us the app store profiles.* All eight of these profiles must be stored on your Mac PC.

== Ad Hoc Provisioning Profiles

=== First Profile

Go to menu:Provisioning Profiles[All], then click the btn:[plus button] at the top right to open the _Add iOS Provisioning Profile_ screen. Select btn:[Ad Hoc] and click btn:[Continue].

== App Store Provisioning Profiles

Creating your four app store profiles works the same way as creating your ad hoc profiles, except that when you start you check the App Store checkbox, and you won’t select testing devices.

When you’re finished, you’ll have eight new provisioning profiles. Remember, when you build your app on ownBuilder, you should only send the four ad hoc profiles, plus your P12 certificate.
