= Create Provisioning Profiles
:toc: right
:description: A provisioning profile is a collection of information that links an App ID with signing certificates and authorized devices.

== Introduction

{description} It is used to control and authorize the devices on which the app can run and the Apple services it can access.

== Overview

The next step is to create five provisioning profiles: either 5 *App Store* profiles if you want to distribute the App via the App Store, or 5 *Ad Hoc* profiles if you want to distribute it differently . All of these profiles must be stored on your Mac PC.
Create a Provisioning Profile


== Create Provisioning Profiles

Now you must create your Provisioning Profiles. Go to menu:Account[Profiles] and click the btn:[plus] button to open the *Register a New Provisioning Profile* screen.

If you want to distribute the App by yourself, select btn:[Ad Hoc]. Otherwise, select btn:[App Store]. The process is similar for both distributions.

Use one of your *App IDs* created in the previous step, and select your Distribution certificate. If you are creating an btn:[Ad Hoc] Profile, you also need to select a test device.

Name your Certificate with a descriptive name so you know which *Profile* corresponds to which *App ID*, afterwards generate and download it.

Repeat this process four more times to create a *Provisioning Profile* for each *App ID* you created previously. In the end, you should have five Profiles, all either being btn:[Ad Hoc] or btn:[App Store] (But all of the same type) and each using one of the following *App IDs*:

* *com.yourcompany.ios-app*
* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-File-Provider*
* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-File-ProviderUI*
* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-Intent*
* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-Share-Extension*

All of these *Provisioning Profiles* should be in your Apple developer Account and downloaded on your Mac.
