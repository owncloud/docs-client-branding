:toc: right
:description: A certificate signing request (CSR) is one of the first steps towards getting your own SSL/TLS certificate.

== Introduction

{description} The CSR usually contains the public key for which the certificate should be issued, identifying information (such as a domain name) and a proof of authenticity including integrity protection (e.g., a digital signature). 

== Setting up a CSR

Start by creating a .certSigningRequest (CSR) file on your Mac, using Keychain Access. Open the Launchpad and type "Keychain" into the search field.
