= Create App IDs
:toc: right
:description: A app ID or app identifier uniquely identifies an application in Apple's ecosystem. This means that no two applications can have the same app identifier.

== Introduction

{description} To avoid conflicts, Apple encourages developers to use reverse domain name notation for choosing an application's app identifier.
 
== Create App IDs

In this step you need to create five *App IDs*. These are unique identifiers for your branded iOS app. You must also create an *App Group* and place your five *App IDs* in your App Group. You will need your base *App ID* and *App Group* when you build your app with the ownBrander app on customer.owncloud.com.

== Create App ID

Now you must create your App ID. Go to *Account > Identifiers* and click the *plus button* to open the "Register a new Identifier" screen.

Choose *App IDs* and select *App* as type.

Fill in your *App ID Description*, which is anything you want, so make it helpful and descriptive. Enter your *App IDs* on the right. The first one should be named *com.yourcompany.ios-app*. You also need to enable only *App Groups* and *Associated Domains*, you shouldn't activate any *App services*.

Create 4 other Identifiers with the same Settings (*App Groups* and *Associated Domains* enabled) and the following App IDs:

* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-File-Provider*
* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-File-ProviderUI*
* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-Intent*
* *com.yourcompany.ios-app.ownCloud-Share-Extension*

Afterwards, you should have five identifiers in total with names similar to the following:

== Create App Group

The next step is to create an App Group and put your App ID in it. Press the *plus button* again but this time select *App Groups*.

Give a fitting description and add *Identifier* in the format *group.com.yourcompany.ios-app*. Then click *Continue*.

Now click on each of your five *App IDs* to add them to your *App Group* by clicking *Edit* and selecting the *App Group* you created.

In the end, you should have *five App IDs*, all added to the *App Group* you created.
