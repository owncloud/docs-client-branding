== Setup

In addition to emailing your four Ad Hoc provisioning profiles to support@owncloud.com, you must also include your P12 certificate. To create this, return to Keychain Access on your Mac computer and find your private key that you created at the beginning (see xref:ios_app/preparation/csr.adoc[Create Certificate Signing Request]).

Right-click on your private key and left-click *Export [your key name]*.

In the next screen you have the option to enter a password. If you put a password on your P12 certificate you will have to include it when you send your certificate and provisioning profiles to support@owncloud.com. Click btn:[OK].
