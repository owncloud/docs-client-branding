= Create Bundle IDs
:toc: right
:description: A bundle ID or bundle identifier uniquely identifies an application in Apple's ecosystem. This means that no two applications can have the same bundle identifier.

== Introduction

{description} To avoid conflicts, Apple encourages developers to use reverse domain name notation for choosing an application's bundle identifier.
 
== Create Bundle IDs

The next step is to create four *Bundle IDs*. These are unique identifiers for your branded iOS app. You must also create an *App Group* and place your three *Bundle IDs* in your *App Group*. You will need your base *Bundle ID* and *App Group* when you build your app with the ownBrander app on {customer-owncloud-url}[customer.owncloud.com].

== Create App ID

Now you must create your App ID. Go to menu:Identifiers[App IDs] and click the btn:[plus button] on the top right to open the "Register iOS App ID" screen. Fill in your *App ID Description*, which is anything you want, so make it helpful and descriptive. The *App ID Prefix* is your Apple Developer Team ID, and is automatically entered for you.

Scroll down to the *App ID Suffix* section and create your *Bundle ID*.
Your *Bundle ID* is the unique identifier for your app.
Make a note of it because you will need it as you continue through this process.
The format for your *Bundle ID* is reverse-domain, e.g. _com.MyCompany.MyProductName_.

The next section, *App Services*, is where you select the services you want enabled in your app.
You can edit this anytime after you finish creating your *App ID*.
Check *App Groups*, make your other selections and then click the btn:[Continue] button at the bottom.
Now you can confirm all of your information.
If everything is correct, click btn:[Submit]; if you need to make changes, use the btn:[Back] button.
