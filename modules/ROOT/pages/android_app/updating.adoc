:description: Follow the procedure and notes when updating your branded Android App.

== Introduction

{description}

IMPORTANT: Since August 2021, Google Play requires the Android App Bundle format (.aab) for publishing new apps. For more details see: https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle[About Android App Bundles]. With this change, the APK has been replaced as the standard publishing format.

== General Information

ownBrander generates 3 artifacts with every build:

| Notes

| `*-release.aab`

For the Android App Bundles, Play App Signing is required. For more details see: https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/the-future-of-android-app-bundles-is.html[The future of Android App Bundles is here]. Play App Signing is a safety feature provided by Google. Every new release will automatically be signed by Google. With this, apps no longer need to be signed locally.

Navigate to the https://play.google.com/console/about/[Google Play Console] page and click on the btn:[Play Console] button.

You will then land on the https://play.google.com/console/developers[Google Play Developer Account] sign-on page. After successful log-on, choose the appropriate developer account.

The page should appear like this. Choose the designated app, which is to be signed and/or updated.

== Create a New Release and Activate App Integrity

Navigate to and click btn:[Production]

and continue by clicking the btn:[Create new release] button.

Google Play Console will guide you through this. Follow the steps to validate your app integrity.
Click the btn:[Activate] button.

image::android_app/updating/android_play_app_integrity.png[Google Play Console App Integrity, width=450]

Since this is a new release version candidate and the key comes from the Java KeyStore, choose this option. 
Otherwise, choose according to your existing key scheme.

image::android_app/updating/android_play_app_signing.png[Google Play Console App Signing, width=450]

Follow the instructions pertaining to the chosen key scheme, here: JavaKeyStore. Download the PEPK-Tool as instructed.

image::android_app/updating/android_play_activate_signing.png[Google Play Console App Activate Signing, width=450]

Gather your keystore parameters:

* KeyStore Alias
* Key Store Password
* Key Alias Password

These are the parameters you previously used to sign your app. Perhaps you kept them stored in the ownBrander.

Input the command below into an open terminal window. As seen in the screen after the command, you can click on the copy-to-clipboard icon (Step 2) to copy the entire command block, but you must modify the "foo" parts of the command as follows:

* `foo.keystore` must be replaced by the `keystore name`, here: damken
* `Alias` is the `app name`, here: damkencloud, aka the `Key Alias`.

[source,java]
----
java -jar pepk.jar --keystore=foo.keystore --alias=foo --output=encrypted_private_key_path
----

After executing the above command, you will be prompted to enter both your *KeyStore Password* and then your *Key Alias Password*. Keep in mind that these passwords remain invisible while you type them. Note that multiple entries or typos lead to errors.

You can also check your signing parameters in ownBrander if you have uploaded them for previous versions.
