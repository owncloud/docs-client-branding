:description: Welcome to the ownCloud Branded Clients documentation. This guide provides information on how to brand, update, deploy or distribute your branded client.

== Introduction

{description}

If you are interested in branding your client, you need to have a branding subscription. Please use the {oc-contact-url}[ownCloud contact form] to get in touch.

== Branding Benefits

Compared to standard clients publicly available, you can provide your customers and/or users with a branded client with white-labeling, theming, feature customization etc. It can be very beneficial to have the corporate look and feel, predefined or disabled settings, profiles and update services just to name some. 

== Target Audience

This documentation focuses on the processes and how-to and is therefore addressed to technically-oriented staff.
