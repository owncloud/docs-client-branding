== Introduction

{description} on {customer-owncloud-url}[customer.owncloud.com]. The ownBrander wizard details the required image specifications.

== Configure Desktop Parameters

If not already done, maintain the xref:prerequisites/ownbrander.adoc#common-section[Common Section] in ownBrander.

Then go to the btn:[Desktop] section of ownBrander, which has two sub-sections, *Required* and *Optional*.

Work your way through the wizard, enter required elements and any optional elements you wish. When you have completed the wizard, press the btn:[Generate Desktop Client] button. You will either get messages warning of any items that need to be corrected, or a success message.

It takes 24-48 hours to build your client. When finalized, you will see it in your account on {customer-owncloud-url}[customer.owncloud.com].
