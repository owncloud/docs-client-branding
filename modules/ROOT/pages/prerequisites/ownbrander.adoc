== Common Section

In the ownBrander wizard at your account, start with the Common section at the top. These entries define your global defaults for all of the platforms in ownBrander. You can change them when you create your apps. You may override any settings inside the menu:Common[] section of the *Client* sections.

Begin on the *Common Tab* and navigate to the *Required* area. Next, enter your application name and the URL of your ownCloud server in the corresponding fields.

When you create production apps, you must then use your real app name, and the URL must point to your real ownCloud server. However, for testing purposes, these values can be anything.
